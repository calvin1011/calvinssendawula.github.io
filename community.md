        <p>
            I support students academically and guide them in navigating STEM fields.  
            Through mentorship, I help students build confidence and problem-solving skills,  
            and four of my mentees have taken on leadership roles in diverse majors.

        <p>
            I organized youth groups and taught them how to grow in Christ and study the Bible.  
            I also led a service project where we installed dog waste disposals in Cottonwood Park  
            to encourage environmental responsibility.
