        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Thank you for checking out my Portfolio</strong></p>

        <p>
            Hi, I am a current student at <strong>Adams State University</strong>, studying Computer Science, graduating in <strong>December 2025</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started coding my junior year of high school when I learned a basic HTML class and fell in love with the art of creating. 
            I wanted this journey to be more than just a basic HTML class, so I chose Computer Science as my career path. 
            I have a strong passion for programming and becoming a better engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am working on a couple of personal full-stack projects while juggling school and preparing for entry into the job market soon.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Summer Plans:</strong> Working as an intern.</p>
