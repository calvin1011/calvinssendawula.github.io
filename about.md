        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Thank you for checking out my Portfolio</strong></p>

        <p>
            Hi, I am a current student at <strong>Adams State University</strong>, studying Computer Science, graduating in <strong>December 2025</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I discovered my passion for coding during my junior year of high school when I took a basic HTML class. 
            The ability to bring ideas to life through code instantly captivated me. However, I wanted to go beyond the fundamentals 
            and deepen my understanding of software development. That drive led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I 
            continue to refine my skills and grow as an engineer. I am deeply passionate about programming and constantly strive to 
            become a better developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am working on a couple of personal full-stack projects while juggling school and preparing for entry into the job market soon.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Summer Plans:</strong> Working as an intern.</p>
